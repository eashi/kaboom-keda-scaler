## What is this?

This is an initial repo for building a [KEDA](https://github.com/kedacore/keda) External Scaler based on .NET Core and gRPC. 

This is not a serious scaler, the plan is to allow Twitch audience in the chat to scale deployments in a cluster by sending the word "!kaboom", and scaling it down by "!feeeesst", or of the like :D.
This hasn't been set in stone yet, so if would think you have a nicer idea keeping reading this README.

## I want to join playing with this, what should I do?

This scaler is built during a live stream on https://twitch.tv/emadashi. Most of the time it is every Thursday (unitl it's done) at 20:00 Melbourne Australia time.

Come and join us, this is a relaxed streaming session we mistakes are allowed and contribution from the audience is highly encouraged :).
